### Testing µAES
---
This folder contains some of the NIST's official [CAVP](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/cavp-testing-block-cipher-modes) test vectors. The `*.rsp` files are courtesy of the NIST. Some sample codes are provided alongside them to illustrate how they are used. The test vectors of OCB mode are borrowed from [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/5a7bc0be97dee9ac715897fe8180a08e211bc6ea/test/evpciph.txt).

Also in the `main.c` file of parent directory, you will find some other test vectors that are either generated by the [Crypto++®](https://www.cryptopp.com) library or taken from various online documents. Please let me know if you faced any issues in verifying them.

Needless to say, the µAES library has been successfully tested against all [CAVP's vectors](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/cavp-testing-block-cipher-modes).
