### Testing µAES
---
This folder contains some of the NIST's official [CAVP](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/cavp-testing-block-cipher-modes) test vectors. The `*.rsp` files are courtesy of the NIST. As of late 2022, they have set up an [official repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP-Server) for cryptographic algorithm validation. Also a few additional FPE test vectors are taken from [[1](https://github.com/ubiqsecurity/ubiq-fpe-c/tree/master/src/test), [2](https://github.com/mysto/python-fpe/tree/main/ff3), [3](https://github.com/0NG/Format-Preserving-Encryption)], and the OCB vectors are borrowed from [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/5a7bc0be97dee9ac715897fe8180a08e211bc6ea/test/evpciph.txt).

Some sample codes are provided alongside these files to demonstrate how their content can be verified. Furthermore, the [`main.c`](../main.c) file contains a bunch of test vectors which are either generated by the [Crypto++®](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp) library or taken from various online documents. Please let me know if you faced any issues in verifying them.

The Visual C++® [prject file](../prj_vc++.vcxproj) in parent directory is configured to compile and run `main.c` in 'Debug' mode, but in Release mode it runs [`aes_testvectors.c`](aes_testvectors.c) for test-vector verification. One can also use Code::Blocks [project files](aes_tests.cbp) if a different compiler is being used. Needless to say, µAES has been successfully tested against all [CAVP's vectors](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/cavp-testing-block-cipher-modes).
